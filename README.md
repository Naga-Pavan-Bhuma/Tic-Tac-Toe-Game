# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a Tic_Tac_Toe Multiplayer Game in which 2 players can play the game.<br>
In My code I Used Neon Text as a heading and message after winning or getting draw.<br>
Also I used the Neon effect for the elements which is placed inside a box which is typically a button<br>
The Java Script Logic of the game can be understandable in the code itself<br>
